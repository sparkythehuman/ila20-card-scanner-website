## What does it do? 

When a foreman assembles a crew, they have a certain number of jobs they need to fill for that day. They currently do this by taking membership cards and keeping count. However, sometimes they lose count and take too many cards. 

This app solves that by:
- Setting a limit of the number of jobs required for that day.
- Scanning the cards and display the count of scanned cards on the screen.
- When the limit is reached, the app will reject any additional scans. 
- Keeping track of who was assigned that day by reading information from the QR code on the members badge.


## How does it work?

1. Foreman sets up the job for the day. This includes: Stevedore Company, Dock, start time, number of jobs, etc.
2. Foreman scans each card until the limit is reached. 
3. Once the limit is reached, no more cards can be scanned and the list can be finalized and saved.
4. Copies of the list can then be printed for admin, accounting, etc use.

Previous day's lists can be viewed by clicking the "List" button.
